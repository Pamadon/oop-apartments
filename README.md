## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate a working knowledge of object properties and methods.
- Create objects using constructor notation, as well as instances of those objects using the new keyword.
- Compare and contrast creating objects using literal notation vs. constructor notation.
- Define methods on your classes.
- Understand object inheritance.

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

#### Requirements

* Implement constructors and prototype methods for `Person`, `Manager`, `Tenant`, `Apartment`, and `Unit` (see starter code in `main.js`).
* Implement inheritance for the following:
  * `Manager` inherits from `Person`.
  * `Tenant` inherits from `Person`.

How do I know if an object is of a particular class type? Use this conditional:

`myObject instanceof MyClass` evaluates to either true or false

#### Starter code

Instructions and starter code can be found in the `main.js` file in the `starter-code/apartment-app` folder.

#### Deliverable

Follow the instructions that are listed in the comments in `main.js`.

Be sure to use the console to check your work where instructed.

## Hungry for More?
- Display each available apartment on the page like so:

- Implement templating when displaying data on the page using [handlebarsjs](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
